# SICP-exercises
My solutions to [SICP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs) exercises

On the summer of 2014 I was on a trip in a place with no internet with a netbook full of computer science books and DrRacket installed.

I have heard good things about SICP so I decided to read the book. I read something like the first 3-4 chapters after which I decided to first read and complete the easier [Little Schemer](https://github.com/Paul-Andre/little-schemer-exercises), and never actually completed it.

This repository contains the exercises I have completed.
